Sum of Two Integers

Given two integers a and b, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators + and -.

Example 1:

Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: a = 2, b = 3
Output: 5
 

Constraints:

-1000 <= a, b <= 1000


Working Notes:
Operations -
1. Bitwise AND (&)
0 & 0 = 0
0 & 1 = 0
1 & 0 = 0
1 & 1 = 1

2. Bitwise OR (|)
0 | 0 = 0
0 | 1 = 1
1 | 0 = 1
1 | 1 = 1

3. Bitwise XOR (^)
0 ^ 0 = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 0 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0

4. Bitwise NOT (!)
!0 = 1
!1 = 0
